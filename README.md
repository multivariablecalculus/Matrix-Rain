# Matrix Rain

This repo is not about classic programming but more about one of the most famous effects related to coding, cybersecurity and hacking. Unfortunately enough, I do not have such skills with which I can create a firewall cracker with this effect so, y'all have to adjust with just the effect.

I wrote the code in C++ since I felt it will be ueasier that way. Anyways, enjoy putting this up on your side monitor for flexing on your friends, if you have any.

Cheers, fellow coders!
